## ðŸŽ¸ Let's rock 
[Who am i?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtXX3aAPPwg) I am a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist... my decadence is any low-level programming, working with hardware, hacking and systems analysis, reading papers and the most favourite development of language tools such as linkers, compilers and so on.  

## ðŸ’¼ For employers
### â›” I don't
  - deal with recruiters 
  - consider offers less than 8k$
  - [do unpaid work like consultations, coding, and so on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFrag8ll85w)
  - consider working from the office
  - [respond from anywhere other than email and linkedin](https://youtu.be/L3oOldViIgY?t=258)
