[Who am i?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtXX3aAPPwg) Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist... my decadence is any low-level programming, working with hardware, hacking and systems analysis, reading papers and the most favourite development of language tools such as linkers, compilers and so on.

[Simple mobile sushi shop](https://github.com/godcodehunter/sushi_shop) - This is a prototype of a mobile application, which was later planned to be used as a web view in a telegram bot. The project has a DEMO at the link.

[Library for binary parsing/printing](https://github.com/godcodehunter/bit-bi-parse) - The library that I initially developed for the task of generating license keys. The key was encoded in base64, and the binary array itself was parsed by this library into program objects. Among other things, when creating the license key module, I used asymmetric encryption to confirm that the key was signed by our license server, and the machine identifier (motherboard id by UEFI) to bind the key to specific machine.
